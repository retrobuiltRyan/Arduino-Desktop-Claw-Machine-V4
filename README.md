Some assembly covered in the link youtube video; so you'll have to figure out assembly/ electronics/code details on your own (this project is from 2015; i didnt abaondon it, just pivioted to a full-scale machine build). Video provides a good explaination of function and innner workings. This project is a bit old and I consider some of the design choices a bit obsolete (been 8years since I design this). However, the wood body (laser cut) is still solid design to remix your own mechatronic ideas. Good luck!

PCB for a handful of darlington transistors (i consider this design and implimention obsolete, but it'll still work)
