Some assembly covered here; but a provide a good explaination of function and innner workings. This project is a bit old and I consider some of the design choices a bit obsolete (been 8years since I design this). However, the wood body (laser cut) is still solid design to remix your own mechatronic ideas. Good luck!

PCB for a handful of darlington transistors (i consider this design and implimention obsolete, but it'll still work)
